# Boilerplate
A skeleton project with all the immense boilerplate for Dagger, Android Architecture Components (ViewModel/LiveData/Repository/Room), Retrofit, RxJava, Glide, AndroidX, etc. pre-written

This project is suited for an app that fetches remote JSON, persists it locally, then reacts to that by displaying the content in a RecyclerView
